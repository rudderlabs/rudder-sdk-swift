/**
 A plugin that sets a given `anonymousId` in the event payload for every event.
 
 **Note**: The `anonymousId` fetched using `AnalyticsClient.anonymousId` would be different from the `anonymousId` set here.
 
 Set this plugin just after the SDK initialization to set the custom `anonymousId` in the event payload for every event:
 ```swift
 analytics.add(SetAnonymousIdPlugin(anonymousId: "someAnonymousId"))
 ```
 
 - Parameter anonymousId: The anonymousId to be set in the event payload. Ensure to preserve this value across app launches.
